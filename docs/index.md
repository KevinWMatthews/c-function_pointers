title: Function Pointers in C
---

Syntax refresher for function pointers in C.


## Background

Function pointers are a powerful language feature in C.  They allow programs
to execute generic behavior without needing to know its implementation details.


## Project Structure

Examples are grouped in directories:
```
c-function_pointers/
├── 1_syntax/
├── 2_syntax_typedef/
├── 3_function_parameter/
├── 4_function_parameter_typedef/
├── 5_struct_element/
└── 6_struct_element_typedef/
```

Each directory holds several self-contained programs.


## Getting Started

See [Setup](setup.md).

title: Function Pointers in C
---

Syntax refresher for function pointers in C.


## Background

Function pointers are a powerful language feature in C.  They allow programs
to execute generic behavior without needing to know its implementation details.


## Project Structure

For simplicity, all examples are in the project's root directory:
```
c-function_pointers/
├── function_parameter/
├── function_parameter_typedef/
├── struct_element/
├── struct_element_typedef/
├── syntax/
└── syntax_typedef/
```

Each directory holds several self-contained, complete examples.


## Getting Started

See [Setup](setup.md).

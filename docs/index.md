title: Function Pointers in C
---

Syntax refresher for function pointers in C.


## Background

Function pointers are a powerful language feature in C.  They allow programs
to execute generic behavior without needing to know its implementation details.


## Project Structure

For simplicity, all four source files live in the project's root directory:
```
c-function_pointers/
├── as_parameter.c
├── basic_syntax.c
├── in_struct.c
└── typedef.c
```


## Getting Started

See [Setup](setup.md).
